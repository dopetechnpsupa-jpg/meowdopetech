  }

### Event System

- Components listen for updates and refresh automatically
- Cross-component communication via window events

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Category ID Requirements**:
   - Must be unique
   - Lowercase only
   - No spaces (use hyphens or underscores)
   - URL-friendly characters only

2. **Protected Categories**:
   - "All Products" category cannot be deleted
   - This ensures the site always has a default filter

3. **Fallback System**:
   - If localStorage is cleared, default categories are restored
   - Ensures the site always has working categories

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Categories Not Updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure localStorage is enabled
- Try refreshing the page

### Icon Not Displaying
- Verify the icon name matches available options
- Check for typos in icon names
- Default to "Grid" if icon is invalid

### Category ID Conflicts
- Ensure each category ID is unique
- Check existing categories before adding new ones
- Use descriptive but short IDs

## 📈 Best Practices

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Keep IDs short but meaningful
   - Use consistent naming patterns

2. **Icon Selection**:
   - Choose icons that represent the category well
   - Maintain visual consistency
   - Consider the icon's appearance at different sizes

3. **Organization**:
   - Group related categories together
   - Use logical ordering
   - Keep the list manageable (recommend 10-15 categories max)

## 🎉 Success Indicators

- Categories appear in main site navigation
- Product forms show updated category lists
- No console errors
