# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Netlify deployment was failing with the error:
```
It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required package(s) installed.
Please install typescript and @types/react by running:
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react
```

## Root Cause
Netlify was not installing `devDependencies` during the build process, which includes the required TypeScript packages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `netlify.toml`
- Changed build command from `npm run build` to `npm run build:netlify`
- Added `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = "false"` to ensure devDependencies are installed

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Modified `build:netlify` script to use `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` instead of `npm install`
- Added `test:build` script for local testing

### 3. Created `.npmrc`
- Set `production=false` to ensure devDependencies are installed
- Set `legacy-peer-deps=true` for compatibility
- Set `include=dev` to explicitly include devDependencies

### 4. Created `test-build.js`
- Added a test script to verify the build process locally
- Checks for TypeScript packages and runs the build

## Files Modified
- `netlify.toml` - Updated build configuration
- `package.json` - Updated build scripts
- `.npmrc` - Added npm configuration (new file)
- `test-build.js` - Added build test script (new file)

## Testing
Run the following command to test the build locally:
```bash
npm run test:build
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Trigger a new Netlify deployment
3. Monitor the build logs to ensure the TypeScript packages are properly installed

## Expected Result
The build should now successfully install TypeScript packages and complete the Next.js build process without errors.
