# Netlify Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
The Netlify deployment was failing with a non-zero exit code during the build process. The error occurred when running `npm run build` in the Netlify environment.

## Root Cause Analysis
The build was failing due to several potential issues:
1. Node.js version compatibility issues
2. Experimental Next.js features causing conflicts
3. Webpack configuration conflicts
4. Dependency installation issues in the CI environment

## Changes Made

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)
- **Removed problematic experimental features**: Removed the `turbo` configuration that was causing webpack conflicts
- **Improved SVG handling**: Added check to prevent duplicate SVG rules in webpack configuration
- **Maintained static export configuration**: Kept `output: 'export'` for Netlify compatibility

### 2. Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- **Updated Node.js version**: Changed from specific version `18.20.0` to `18.x` for better compatibility
- **Added NPM flags**: Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle dependency conflicts
- **Updated build command**: Changed to use `npm run build:netlify` for better control

### 3. Package.json Scripts
- **Added Netlify-specific build script**: `build:netlify` that includes dependency installation
- **Fixed build:check script**: Changed from `pnpm build` to `npm run build` for consistency
- **Added debug script**: `debug:deployment` for troubleshooting deployment issues

### 4. Debug Tools
- **Created deployment debug script**: `scripts/debug-deployment.js` to help identify deployment issues
- **Comprehensive environment checking**: Script checks Node.js version, environment variables, critical files, and system resources

## Testing
- ✅ Local build works correctly
- ✅ All pages generate successfully
- ✅ Static export completes without errors
- ✅ Bundle optimization works as expected

## Deployment Steps

### For Netlify Deployment:
1. Ensure all changes are committed to the repository
2. Netlify will automatically use the updated `netlify.toml` configuration
3. The build command `npm run build:netlify` will:
   - Install dependencies with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
   - Run the Next.js build process
   - Generate static files in the `out` directory

### For Local Testing:
```bash
# Test the Netlify build process locally
npm run build:netlify

# Run debug script to check environment
npm run debug:deployment

# Standard build (for development)
npm run build
```

## Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in Netlify:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:
1. Run the debug script: `npm run debug:deployment`
2. Check Netlify build logs for specific error messages
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure Node.js version compatibility (18.x)

### Common Issues:
- **Dependency conflicts**: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag should resolve most conflicts
- **Memory issues**: The build process has been optimized to reduce memory usage
- **Timeout issues**: Static export should complete within Netlify's time limits

## Monitoring
- Monitor build times in Netlify dashboard
- Check for any new dependency conflicts
- Verify that all pages are generating correctly
- Test the deployed site functionality

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing build caching for faster rebuilds
- Monitor bundle sizes and optimize if needed
- Implement automated testing before deployment
- Set up staging environment for testing changes

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting the `next.config.mjs` changes
2. Restoring the original `netlify.toml` configuration
3. Removing the new build scripts from `package.json`

## Support
For additional help:
1. Check Netlify documentation for Next.js deployments
2. Review Next.js static export documentation
3. Use the debug script to identify specific issues
4. Check the deployment logs in Netlify dashboard
