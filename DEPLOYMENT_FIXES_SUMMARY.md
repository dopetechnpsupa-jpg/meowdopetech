# Deployment Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. MIME Type Errors ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: `Refused to execute script from 'https://dopetechnepal.netlify.app/_next/static/css/72d81fa628c6aa20.css' because its MIME type ('text/css') is not executable`

**Root Cause**: CSS files were being served with incorrect MIME types, causing browsers to try to execute them as JavaScript.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `netlify.toml` with proper Content-Type headers for all file types
- Added MIME type configurations for CSS, JS, SVG, MP4, PNG, JPG, WebP, AVIF
- Created `.htaccess` and `web.config` files for additional server support
- Added proper headers configuration in Next.js config

### 2. 404 Asset Errors ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Multiple 404 errors for static assets:
- `/video/footervid.mp4`
- `/logo/dopelogo.svg`
- `/payment/paymentQR.svg`
- `/placeholder.jpg`
- `/manifest.json`

**Root Cause**: Missing or incorrectly referenced static assets.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created asset checking script (`scripts/check-static-assets.js`)
- Added fallback redirects in `netlify.toml`
- Ensured all required assets are present in `/public` directory
- Created fallback assets for missing files

### 3. Multiple Supabase Client Instances ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: `Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context`

**Root Cause**: Supabase client being initialized multiple times across the application.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Implemented singleton pattern in `lib/supabase.ts`
- Disabled session persistence, auto refresh, and session detection
- Added proper client instance management
- Prevented multiple client creation

### 4. DOM Manipulation Errors ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: `NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node`

**Root Cause**: React trying to remove DOM nodes that don't exist or have already been removed.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Improved video error handling with safer DOM manipulation
- Added proper node existence checks before DOM operations
- Enhanced error boundary component
- Added global error and unhandled rejection handlers

### 5. Missing Manifest File ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: `Manifest fetch from https://dopetechnepal.netlify.app/manifest.json failed, code 404`

**Root Cause**: Missing or incorrectly configured manifest.json file.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Ensured `manifest.json` exists in `/public` directory
- Added proper Content-Type header for manifest files
- Updated manifest with correct icon references

## Performance Improvements

### Caching
- Added proper cache headers for all static assets (1 year cache)
- Implemented immutable cache for versioned assets
- Added cache control for different file types

### Loading Optimization

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check static assets
node scripts/check-static-assets.js

# Run comprehensive fixes
node scripts/fix-deployment-issues.js

# Build with asset checks
pnpm run build:check

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify these issues are resolved:

- [ ] No MIME type errors in browser console
- [ ] No 404 errors for static assets
- [ ] No multiple Supabase client warnings

- [ ] All images and videos load correctly
- [ ] Logo displays properly
- [ ] Manifest file loads without errors
- [ ] PWA functionality works correctly

## Prevention Measures

### For Future Deployments
1. Always run `node scripts/check-static-assets.js` before deployment
2. Use `pnpm run build:check` for builds with asset validation
3. Monitor browser console for any new errors
4. Keep the deployment checklist updated

### Monitoring
- Set up error tracking for production
- Monitor asset loading performance
- Track user experience metrics
- Regular health checks of static assets

## Support

If issues persist after applying these fixes:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure Netlify build settings are configured properly
4. Review the deployment checklist for missed items
5. Check server logs for additional error details
